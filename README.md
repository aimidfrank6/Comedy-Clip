spirit create a Miata clean yet and we
00:13
knew the word spirit within a spirit to
00:17
serve you
00:20
hallelujah we all get off track I know I
00:25
get off track but the the scripture says
00:29
that if we sin we have an advocate with
00:32
the bothering then we add heat how do we
00:38
have access Jesus Christ ten rushes to
00:44
fix us up amen to review us and to
00:47
changes and just flowing with that the
00:50
message pulpit etiquette
00:54
you know Hebrews 13 one of our key
00:57
scriptures verse 17 says obey them that
01:01
have the rule over you and submit to
01:03
them for they watching behalf of your
01:06
souls as they that shall give an account
01:10
that they may do it with joy and not
01:13
with grief for grief was not was
01:17
uncomfortable for you I remember this
01:21
turn over to Philippians we have to see
01:37
we have to be reminded Lord why am i
01:42
doing what I'm doing
01:43
sometimes we have to reexamine ourselves
01:48
take evaluation hello Philippians
01:57
imitating Christ humility chapter two if
02:02
you have any encouragement from being
02:04
United with Christ if any comfort from
02:07
his love
02:08
any fellowship with this spirit if any
02:10
tendon is not compassion then make my
02:13
joy complete by being like-minded having
02:16
the same love being one of the spirit
02:19
and purpose first of all please remind
02:21
me of my time
02:23
do not do nothing out of selfish
02:26
ambition there it is are the area find
02:30
out why am I doing this is it so that
02:34
people can see how pretty my voices or
02:39
people can see how smart I am what what
02:45
what is this all about do nothing out of
02:49
selfish ambition or being concerned
02:51
anemia but in humility consider others
02:56
better than ourselves probably and
02:59
that's how images that's how we
03:01
dismantle pride each of you should look
03:06
not only to your own interests but also
03:09
to the interests of others your attitude
03:14
should be the same as that of Christ
03:16
Jesus who being in very nature God did
03:20
not consider equality with God something
03:23
to be grasped but made himself nothing
03:26
taking the very nature of a servant
03:28
hallelujah being made in human likeness
03:31
and being found in appearance as a man
03:34
he humbled himself and became obedient
03:37
to death even death on a cross
03:40
careful God exalted him to the highest
03:43
place and gave him the name that is
03:46
above every name that at the name of
03:49
Jesus every knee should bow in heaven on
03:52
and under the earth and every tongue
03:55
confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the
03:57
glory of God the Father that spirit of
04:01
humility should be in our spirits
04:05
because we have the Spirit of Christ
04:06
amen amen
04:08
and when that flesh wants to rise up the
04:12
scripture says we got a crucified on an
04:15
idiom crucify our flesh because we want
04:19
the Lord's glory and the Lord's purpose
04:22
to be exalted
04:24
amen amen it's not a show it's a worship
04:31
time everything that we do on this
04:34
platform of this podium was a service is
04:38
a worship unto God we're excited to do
04:42
it for the Lord we're honored to serve
04:45
Him but it is for his glory because
04:49
without his glory we accomplished
04:52
nothing without his presence we
04:56
accomplished nothing without his green
05:00
light we accomplished nothing
05:03
and we've all been there done that
05:06
amen man that's part of growing pains in
05:09
the Lord we are called to minister or do
05:15
something we're not called to take over
05:19
that's what that's what it says here in
05:22
are manually men were thought to be
05:24
respectful to the minister and if the
05:27
minister
05:28
says no I don't need this at this moment
05:31
we have to cope with ourselves
05:34
thank you lord we gotta do it
05:38
amen and if by any chance we had an
05:42
attitude we gotta check it hallelujah if
05:46
we had an attitude about it we have to
05:48
check it because God is looking at our
05:51
heart
05:52
amen amen we don't want to come up to
05:56
show our nice outfit even though God has
06:01
blessed us to have it then God doesn't
06:04
want us to be looking ridiculous either
06:07
right to be presentable but our what is
06:11
the motive of hearts father created us a
06:17
clean heart and renew the right spirit
06:20
within us so our dressing should be
06:23
modest our dressing set is for worship
06:30
learning whatever I do help me to honor
06:34
you being mindful that the minister and
06:40
the service is not ours it is the
06:46
minister and if we're honest like the
06:49
the manual says if work has to to share
06:53
a slum share a song if you're asked to
06:57
testify testified we're not supposed to
07:00
testify in the dance and do all the
07:03
other stuff to take over we just do when
07:07
come at the certain time has asked us to
07:11
do amen and and we got it and one of the
07:15
ways that we least we function in life
07:19
mind
07:20
being filled continuously being filled
07:23
with the spirit
07:24
praise God just being continuously
07:27
father died being filled with the Word
07:30
of God I get I right now I'm just so
07:35
excited about reading God's Word and see
07:39
what the Lord is doing with his people
07:41
in the book of Acts it's by his spirit
07:46
to know that you know I was just being
07:51
last night about these sons of sceva
07:54
you have to remember that story the the
07:57
Paulding they would feel with the spirit
07:59
the the Jesus that Paul preaches and
08:05
then and that demon who recognized and
08:09
he says but if he seen thought I know I
08:14
know how I know Paul and Jesus I don't
08:17
before you I can't be operating in my
08:21
flesh casting out no demon because then
08:26
they're gonna they're gonna put a good
08:28
weapon on us hello that's why we need
08:32
the glory and when we stand to Minister
08:38
make sure make sure we're not standing
08:43
in the pulpit and lying down in a bed
08:45
with someone who is not a spouse make
08:49
sure that we have the righteousness of
08:52
God in Christ Jesus you know I went out
08:55
when I first started ministering this
08:57
message I used to ask why don't you just
09:01
what I prefer
09:02
I'd prefer if I know that I'm missing
09:05
I'll sit down take a timeout let God do
09:12
his thing but some some people they
09:16
don't want to leave the podium I did
09:19
this I made this ministry I started this
09:24
ministry but you know what man is
09:33
replaceable God can replace anybody any
09:38
time just like that so if you don't want
09:44
to humble yourself under the mighty hand
09:46
of god god will humble us it's so much
09:51
easier and easier and less embarrassing
09:55
when we do it ourselves when we sit down
10:00
and have a talk with Jesus and do you
10:05
know the closet thing go in the closet
10:08
work it out with the Lord rather than
10:11
you stand up behind the podium and God
10:13
I'll just sit you down and the whole
10:17
world sees but I got the answer why so
10:23
many ministers who play around in the
10:26
closet doing what they're not supposed
10:29
to do and then standing on the pull of
10:32
the pulpit preaching you know what it is
10:35
it's money that's what it is it's not
10:40
God it's money that's the motivation and
10:44
I'll close with this in Timothy god help
10:51
us
10:54
is that that they can't sit down they
10:57
won't sit down and then won't sit down
11:00
is because they're getting a salary so
11:05
if they know if they sit down they're
11:06
not gonna get paid but get it right get
11:11
it right before you shame the button of
11:13
Christ and you drag the name of Jesus
11:17
through the mud first Timothy chapter 3
11:24
there are always close with this the
11:27
Lord keep us cuz I'm not looking to rest
11:30
out I just want to say that we cannot
11:33
look to ourselves to keep ourselves we
11:36
gotta look unto Jesus the author and
11:39
finisher of our faith he's the one that
11:42
keeps us amen
11:43
he's gonna quit he keeps us if you wanna
11:47
be kept
11:51
he keeps us if we want to be kept I want
11:55
to be kept I get tempted but I want to
11:58
be kept because I want the goal you
12:04
you're discovered I'm coming from Earth
12:06
I'm going to finish the race the race is
12:11
not given to the Swift nor to the strong
12:13
but to them that endure we're gonna fall
12:16
we're going to fail but we can't we
12:18
can't wallow and sin after price has
12:22
sent to find us first Timothy chapter 3
12:26
and it says here's
12:28
trustworthy singing if anyone sets his
12:30
heart on being an overseer he desires a
12:35
noble task now the overseer must be
12:38
above reproach
12:40
not in reproach above people may say all
12:45
manner of evil against you but make sure
12:47
what this thing is not true make sure
12:51
that this issue humbly ourselves under
13:11
the mighty hand of God
13:14
now the overseer must be above reproach
13:17
the husband of but one wife temperate
13:23
self-control respectable hospitable able
13:28
to teach not given to drunkenness not
13:32
violent but gentle not quarrelsome not a
13:36
lover of money he must manage his own
13:39
family well and see that his children
13:41
obey Him with proper respect if anyone
13:45
does not know how to manage his own
13:47
family how can he take care of God's
13:49
church you can so then the church's
13:53
mismanage because if the families
13:57
mismanaged the church's being mismanaged
13:59
but if we repent it will repent he's
14:05
faithful and just to forgive us of our
14:08
sins and to cleanse us up
14:12
that sounds like a very good deal to me
14:14
yeah hello man that sounds like a great
14:18
deal to me he must not be a recent
14:24
convert or he may be come or he may
14:28
become become conceited and fall under
14:31
the same judgment as the devil he must
14:34
also have a good reputation with
14:36
outsiders so that he will not fall into
14:39
disgrace and into the devil's trap man
14:45
you see it right there and the last
14:49
verse deacons likewise are to be men
14:52
worthy of respect
14:53
sincere not indulging in much wine and
14:57
not pursuing dishonesty they must keep
15:00
hold of the deep truths of the faith
15:03
with a clear conscience Alleluia and
15:07
they must first be tested and then if
15:11
there is nothing against them let them
15:13
serve not just as deacons but we have a
15:20
higher calling
15:21
amen and a higher calling means up
15:24
higher standard and a higher standard
15:27
means might be a swifter judgment and
15:32
God my husband reminded brother the
15:36
other day that God never destroys a city
15:39
unless he ones God talks to us and he
15:44
warns us amen amen
15:47
so continue to pray for our fellow
15:50
ministers that you may be aware that are
15:52
not on track with God right now because
15:56
God is money so that they too can be
16:01
strengthened amen if they choose so so
16:05
pulpit etiquette as I close it it goes
16:09
deep it's not just oh he has a lot of
16:13
charisma where is God's glory that's
16:18
what we should be
16:19
for where is God's glory listening for
16:24
God's voice and the scripture says that
16:27
we should test the spirits don't just
16:33
slow everything that comes for that's my
16:37
behind a pulpit we gotta tell the
16:40
bereaved in Christians this they tested
16:44
it is this of God so we don't just take
16:50
stuff and then damage our spirits your
16:54
walk amen yeah so to God be the glory
16:59
let somebody serious sometimes we need
17:08
it
